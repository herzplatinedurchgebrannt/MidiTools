Midi Drum Converter, Bass Tab Creator, Drum Sequencer

This is a follow up project of some python music scripts.
Its created w. Electon + Angular, so its running on Win/MacOs/Linux. Cool!

Its a collection of simple tools I often need for my music stuff.
My handwritten tabs for my bands bass player sucked, so I coded this simple bass tab creator.
It works pretty good, but only when you export the bass midi file out of Logic Pro X (Dont know what happens in other DAWs?!).

Midi drum converter is made for Drum Midi Loops. You can convert for example your SSD5 loops to GGD. 
Add new drummaps to the JSON file.

Drum sequencer is under construction, but playing around works. Adding a midi export would be cool.
